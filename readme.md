# Welcome to LDrawy
### Summary
LDrawy is a work in progress project aiming to provide a really simple but flexible render system to create your own frameworks based on it (Apps, Engines, Simulations, etc).

Currently is under heavy development and is not recommened to be used until some basic features are implemented. However feel free to give it a try and share your feedback and suggestions.

### Examples
Currently examples are work in progress. However [here](examples/dev/main.rs) you can find one to easily understand how to use LDrawy.
